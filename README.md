# Hierarchical Tables in PostgreSQL
In this research, we focus on a small dataset and select a hierarchical tagset
of vegetarian recipes which has been used as a restaurant menu. The main idea is to
implement the hierarchical tagset within hierarchical tables in a relational database
(e.g. PostgreSQL).
